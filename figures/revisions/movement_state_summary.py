Reviewer check: facial/whisker movement during the passive mapping epoch,
across days.

Addresses the concern that the brain state during the post-session passive
whisker-stimulation block (cf. figure_3c.py, figure_4) might not be matched
across training days. This complements
figures/revisions/behavior_state_summary.py (session duration, trial
count, total water), by directly quantifying movement during the passive
epoch itself.

Data source: DeepLabCut trial matrices (not NWB), one .h5 file per mouse in
DLC_DIR, produced independently by G. Foustoukos. The .h5 layout (traces,
feature_names, time, per-session norm_sessions/norm_constants, trials) and
the loading logic below were verified against his load_dlc.py in that same
directory, then reimplemented here (_load_dlc_h5) so this script has no
import-time dependency on that external file. Available for 12 mice only
(a subset of the full cohort -- mice without a DLC file are silently
skipped). Of those 12, only one (GF319) is R-, so an R+ vs R- group
comparison is not statistically meaningful from this dataset alone (n=1);
this script therefore reports R+ mice only, across days. Each file holds,
per recording day relative to the whisker learning day (-2, -1, 0, +1, +2),
one array of shape (n_trials, n_features, n_time) for the 50 passive/
"unmotivated" (UM) whisker trials, sampled at 100 Hz with the whisker
stimulus at time 0.

Features are speed and amplitude for 5 DeepLabCut-tracked body parts
(tongue, whisker end, nose, whisker base, jaw end) -- 10 features total.
Traces are used raw (NORMALISED=False; Georgios's per-session (v-mean)/
(max-min) rescaling is not applied here). For each trial, four raw numbers
are computed per feature: the pre-stimulus BASELINE_WINDOW mean (-2 to 0 s),
the post-stimulus WINDOW mean (0 to 1 s), the post-stimulus WINDOW peak
(max), and the post-stimulus WINDOW RMS deviation from that trial's own
baseline. Six summary statistics are derived from these and each plotted/
saved separately (one svg + one data csv each), since they answer slightly
different questions:
    mean        -- post-stimulus window mean, no baseline correction
    peak        -- post-stimulus window peak, no baseline correction
    baseline    -- pre-stimulus baseline mean (ongoing idle movement level,
                   not a stimulus response)
    blsub_mean  -- post-stimulus mean minus that trial's own baseline
    blsub_peak  -- post-stimulus peak minus that trial's own baseline
    energy      -- RMS of the post-stimulus trace around that trial's own
                   baseline (unsigned "motion energy": movement in both
                   directions adds up instead of cancelling, unlike
                   blsub_mean/blsub_peak)

Each panel (one per body part x metric) is also annotated with a Friedman
test (nonparametric repeated-measures ANOVA, matched by mouse) for whether
the 5 days differ, rather than a Kruskal-Wallis test across days -- the 11
R+ mice are the same across all 5 days, so treating each day as an
independent sample (as Kruskal-Wallis would) ignores that repeated-measures
structure, the same pseudoreplication issue already flagged and fixed for
the reactivation panels (see figure_4i_j_lmm.py's docstring); mice missing
any of the 5 days are dropped from that panel's test (complete-case).
